9. **Explain how simple client-server communication is done:**
   - In simple client-server communication:
     - The **client** initiates communication by sending a request to the server.
     - The **server** listens for incoming requests.
     - Upon receiving a request, the server processes it and sends a response back to the client.
     - Communication is typically based on a protocol (e.g., HTTP for web communication), and sockets may be used for establishing a connection.

10. **What is Interceptor? Explain briefly:**
    - An **Interceptor** is a software component that intercepts and modifies the behavior of a system. In the context of distributed systems, interceptors are often used to add functionalities such as logging, security checks, or performance monitoring to communication between components.

11. **Briefly explain the iterative name resolution technique:**
    - **Iterative Name Resolution** is a DNS (Domain Name System) resolution method where a DNS client queries multiple DNS servers in a step-by-step fashion until it obtains the desired information or an authoritative server is reached. Each server queried provides a referral to the next server until the resolution is complete.

12. **Write a short note on Process Resilience:**
    - **Process Resilience** refers to a system's ability to maintain its functionality and recover from failures in individual processes. Resilient processes can handle faults, restart if necessary, and continue providing their services to the overall system.

13. **Explain Firewall in detail:**
    - A **Firewall** is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, filtering and blocking or allowing traffic based on specified criteria. Firewalls are crucial for protecting networks from unauthorized access, cyber attacks, and other security threats.

14. **What is RMI (Remote Method Invocation)? Explain briefly:**
    - **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** is a Java-based framework that allows methods of remote objects to be invoked from other Java Virtual Machines (JVMs), possibly on different physical machines. RMI enables communication between distributed Java applications, providing a mechanism for remote procedure calls.

19. **Write a short note on digital signature:**

   - A **digital signature** is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document. It involves using a private key to generate a unique digital signature, which can be verified by anyone who has access to the corresponding public key. Digital signatures are used for ensuring the origin, identity, and non-repudiation of digital messages or documents.

20. **Discuss persistent and non-persistent HTTP connection:**

   - **Persistent HTTP Connection:** In a persistent connection, the client and server keep the connection open after the initial request and response, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over the same connection. This reduces the overhead of opening and closing connections for each request.

   - **Non-persistent HTTP Connection:** In a non-persistent connection, a new connection is established for each request, and it is closed as soon as the response is delivered. This approach incurs the overhead of connection establishment for each request, especially for multiple small requests.

21. **Explain causal consistency:**

   - **Causal Consistency:** Causal consistency is a consistency model in distributed systems that ensures a causal relationship between related events is preserved. In other words, if one operation causally affects another, the system guarantees that the order of these operations is maintained. However, operations that are not causally related may be seen in different orders by different nodes.

22. **Discuss different alternatives of client-server organization:**

   - **Two-Tier Architecture:** Involves a client directly communicating with a server. Suitable for small-scale applications.

   - **Three-Tier Architecture:** Introduces an intermediate application server between the client and the data server. Enhances scalability and modularity.

   - **N-Tier Architecture:** Involves multiple layers, each serving a specific purpose. Can include presentation, application, business, and data tiers. Offers flexibility and scalability for large and complex systems.

   - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P):** All nodes in the network have equivalent capabilities and responsibilities. Suitable for decentralized and distributed applications. Examples include file-sharing networks.
